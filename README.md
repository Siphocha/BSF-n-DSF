This is the read through of the Algorithms made and created.

Determine the time complexity for big graphs with V vertices and E edges:

Ans: From the graphs we are using, they are both O(V+E) time based ones. This makes them both run at very fast rates (albeit not the fastest in comparison to other algorithm and structure based ones).

We used the exact same data type structures of nodes for both of them. specifcially the nodes based on a diagram. That is 12 Vertices and 14 associated edges.

Determine other algorithms that make use of BFS and DFS:

1. Sorting algorithms and especially puzzle based algorithms. 
2. Puzzle algorithms because, because these algorithm types in puzzle situations try to find different solutions simultaneously or hyper focus on routes).
3. Traversal Algorithms
4. Unweighted graph path searching algorithms
